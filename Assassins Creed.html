          Assassin's Creed: Revelations is an action-adventure, 
        stealth game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective,
        the game follows three distinct protagonists: Ezio Auditore, Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad, and Desmond Miles.
        </p>
        <p>
          When playing as Ezio or Altaïr, 
          the game retains the series' standard gameplay formula, 
          consisting of a mixture of combat, stealth, and exploration. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Revelations does add several new features; most notably, 
          the "Hookblade," which acts as a replacement for Ezio's traditional dual Hidden Blade,
          (which is broken at the beginning of the game).
        </p>
        <p>The Hookblade is intended to facilitate traversal and compensate for Ezio's old age, 
          allowing him to climb buildings much faster and reach further ledges, 
          It can also be used to jump over large gaps and access ziplines across the environment.
