                "timed finishing"— where the kick button may be pressed a second time to determine the exact moment the ball is 
                actually kicked,"50/50 battles"— a system for determining how likely a player will win loose balls, 
                and switch between them in real-time during a match.

              Gameplay changes to FIFA 20 focus primarily on a new feature titled VOLTA Football. The mode, 
              which translates to 'return' in Portuguese, focuses on street football rather than the traditional matches associated 
              with the FIFA series, similar to the FIFA Street series.

                  and animations on and off the ball in real time.
